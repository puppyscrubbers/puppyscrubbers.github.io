        <p>The <em>Aqualine Empinada</em> is awesome because it destroys <strong>anything</strong> in its sight and is not to be messed with. It has a ferocious attitude but is gentle towards its mates</p>
        
        <p>The Empinada can eat large quantities of food the size of a <em>Blue Whale</em>! This sea creature is not to be messed with.  Although it can fight, it has hands.... and is not afraid to use 'em..</p>
