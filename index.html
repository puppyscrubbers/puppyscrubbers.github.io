        <p>The <em>Aqualine Empinada</em> is awesome because it destroys <strong>anything</strong> in its sight and is not to be messed with.</p>

        <p>The <em>Aqualine Seed</em> is the beginning of the Aqualine Empinada's evolution period. Although it has not learned to fight, this cute little blue ball roars at its predators to scare them away. It feeds on remaining yolks from the egg it was hatched in.</p>

        <p>The Aqualine Seed has now evolved into the <em>Aqualine Seedling</em>. This guy is a handful. It doesn't get on well with it's cousins, the Landline Seedlings. The Seedling can now fight for itself snd has become the <strong>predator</strong> instead of the prey.</p>

        <p>This guy... You thought we were done, but this is just the beginning of the terror we call the <em>  Aqualine Sapling</em>! This creature doesn't take no for an answer... If you try to square up, he'll give you those H.A.N.D.S in a matter of <strong>seconds</strong>!!!</p>
        
        <p>And that's it for the Aqualine Empinada's Evolution Line!</p>
